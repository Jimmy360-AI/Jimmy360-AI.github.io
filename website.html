		<p> 	Spooky scary skeletons
			Send shivers down your spine
			Shrieking skulls will shock your soul
			Seal your doom tonight
			Spooky scary skeletons
			Speak with such a screech
			You'll shake and shudder in surprise
			When you hear these zombies shriek
			We're so sorry skeletons
			You're so misunderstood
			You only want to socialize
			But I don't think we should
			Cause spooky scary skeletons
			Shout startling shrilly screams
			They'll sneak from their sarcophagus
			And just won't leave you be
